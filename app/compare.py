"""Transcripts of one recording: grouping them, comparing them side by side, and combining them.

A recording is often transcribed with several models. "Run again with" makes a new job on the same
audio (rerun_of, audio.flac shared by hardlink), and the same file can also be added again. Jobs are in
one group when rerun_of links them, or when their audio has the same fingerprint: the SHA-256 of the decoded samples, stored in job.json when the audio is prepared and
worked out in the background for jobs made before that.

Comparing lines the transcripts up by time. Rows are cut only where no line of any transcript is
running, give or take a little at the ends of lines (models place boundaries differently), so each
line is in exactly one row: the one its middle falls in. Words that differ are marked after a light
normalization, so punctuation, case, diacritics and common spelling variants don't count.

Combining keeps the base transcript's lines everywhere except in the stretches picked from another one
(a row or a time range; where picks overlap, the later one wins). A line is kept or dropped whole,
depending on where its middle is. The other transcripts' speakers are mapped onto the base's by how
long they talk at the same time, and the base's speaker names carry over. The result is saved as a new
version of the base transcript (app/history.py), so it is reviewed as a diff first and can be restored
from, or undone in, its History; version 0 stays the model's output.
