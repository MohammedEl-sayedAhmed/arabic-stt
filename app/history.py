"""Version history of a transcript, kept like version control: the model's output is version 0 and never
changes, and every change saved in the app is a new version (1, 2, ...) with an optional message. The
edits of one session in edit mode are one version, reviewed as a diff before they are saved (preview).
Quick changes outside edit mode (renaming or merging speakers, the title) are a version each, folded
into one when they come close together. Going back to an earlier version saves it again as the newest.

A job folder's history/ holds index.json, one entry per version ({n, time, kind, message, summary,
parent}), and one snapshot per version (v0000.json, v0001.json, ...: title, speaker_names, lines). The
current version is also in transcript.json and job.json as before, so the rest of the app reads those.
A job that finished before the history existed gets one the first time it is opened: version 0 is the
model's output if the folder still has it, version 1 the transcript as it was by then.
